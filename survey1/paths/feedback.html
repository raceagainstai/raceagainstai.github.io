    <p id='otherFeedback'>Definitely a topic I'll be paying more attention to now. Interesting to see how retail could change the world.</p>
    <p id="otherFeedback">I hope that my kids will be studying subjects they love and won't be automated.</p>
    <p id="otherFeedback">I wonder what the future of fine arts would look like? If AI has this much influence, how does it affect the fine arts industry?</p>
    <p id="otherFeedback">The bit about truck drivers seems kind of out there, I definitely think assembly work could be fully automated in the next 10 years.</p>
    <p id="otherFeedback">I'm worried about my high school students and how they're going to handle studying for subjects that may be automated by the time they get out of college.</p>
    <p id="otherFeedback">Fuck the coastal elitists who think they can just automate whatever they want</p>
    <p id="otherFeedback">I really like the story telling . The imagery with the narration of the workers going about their daily tasks was perfect. I wouldve liked to see more negative things about this time though.</p>
